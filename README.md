## Usage

1. **Navigate to any LeetCode problem** (e.g., https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

2. **Click the "Save to Notion" button** that appears in the top-right corner

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Question Name**: Enter the problem name manually (e.g., "Two Sum", "Valid Parentheses")
   - **Topics**: Auto-filled if available, or add manually (e.g., "Array, Hash Table")
   - **Intuition/Trick**: Your solution approach, key insights, or tricks

4. **Click "Save to Notion"** and you're done! âœ…

## Data Storage Structure

### Database Properties (Table Columns)
- **Question Name**: Stored as the page title
- **Topics**: Stored as text in the Topics column  
- **URL**: Direct link to the LeetCode problem
- **Date Added**: Automatically set to today's date

### Page Content (Inside Each Notion Page)
- **Intuition/Trick**: Saved as formatted content blocks inside each page
  - Creates a "Intuition/Trick" heading
  - Followed by your notes in paragraph format
  - This allows for rich formatting and unlimited text length

## File Structure

```
LeetScribe/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ content.js             # Main script that runs on LeetCode pages
â”œâ”€â”€ background.js          # Handles Notion API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css             # Styling for the save button and modal
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.html             # Extension settings popup
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.js               # Popup functionality
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`): Runs on LeetCode problem pages, adds the save button and modal
2. **Background Script** (`background.js`): Handles secure API calls to Notion
3. **Popup** (`popup.html/js`): Provides interface for configuration and viewing saved entries
4. **Local Storage**: Keeps backup copies of all saved entries


## Privacy & Security

- Your Notion token is stored securely in Chrome's sync storage
- All data is encrypted in transit to Notion's servers
- No data is sent to any third-party servers other than Notion
- Local backups are stored only on your device
